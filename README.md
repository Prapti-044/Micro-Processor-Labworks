## Introduction

A microprocessor is a computer processor that incorporates the functions of a central processing unit on a single (or more) integrated circuit (IC)[1][2] of MOSFET construction. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.
